I am learning to code so I can switch a 16+ year career in law enforcement to
something a bit less stressful.  Looking back on what made me think of coding
was a story in the news.  A journalist discovered educator's social security 
numbers easily found by using the 'inspect' function; looking at the base HTML.
The story goes that the Gov. of that state demonized the journalist and called
him a hacker while pushing for a criminal investigaion.  Ultimately the Gov 
was/is an idiot and the journalist was not criminally charged because, you know,
it's not a crime to look at publicly available information. Especially if it is
a vunerability by crappy coding.

Started Colt Steele's Udemy course to get a gist of it and got turned on to TOP
while reading the r/learnprogramming subreddit.  And here I am!  I have max
of 4 years left in my current field and am planning ahead for the next adventure.
